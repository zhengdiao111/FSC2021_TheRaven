# UCI NIH Foundations Short Course: The Raven

A group activity where we each edit a line of the poem by Edgar Allan Poe, __The Raven__.

The plan:

1. Generate a random number using [www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator](https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator).

2. If it is 1, fork this repo from allardjun. The "Fork" button is at top-right

3. If the random number is greater than 1, click the number to the right of the "Fork" button. You will see a list of users who have forked it from allardjun. Fork the repo from one of them. Note it might take a minute for the lucky users from Step 2 to fork first.

4. Everyone: In *your* repo, click the file `main.tex`. Click the edit button, which is a pencil icon at the right of the screen, between a monitor icon and a trash icon.

5. Edit a line in the poem to say whatever you want (this will be public).

6. Commit! The button is at the bottom of screen

7. Make a Pull Request. Use the "Pull Request" tab in the horizontal tab list, and then "New Pull Request" button on right of the screen.
